 <h2 class="one">Description</h2>
 <p class="two">This twist on classic gazpacho will be a welcome, refreshing sight on those hot summer days!</p>
 <p class="two">This refreshing chilled soup is the perfect way to use up a leftover hunk of watermelon that you might have hanging out in the fridge after last weekend’s picnic. When blended together with lots and lots of summer veggies, a handful of fresh mint, a slice of bread and some simple seasonings, this gazpacho tastes like summertime sunshine in a bowl. And it is delicious!</p>
 <p class="two">Bonus? This watermelon gazpacho recipe only takes about 15 minutes to prep and can be made up to two days in advance. Plus it’s made with fresh and healthy ingredients that are also naturally vegan and gluten-free (if you use gf bread), which makes gazpacho an especially great option if you happen to be cooking for a crowd this summer. We often turn to gazpacho when we’re entertaining this time of year since it’s so easy to prep ahead of time — usually just serving it up with a light salad and a loaf of crusty bread — and it hits the spot every time!</p>
 
 <h2 class="one">Ingredients</h2>
 <ul class="ul">
  <li  class="li">4 cups cubed seeded watermelon</li>
  <li  class="li">2 roma (plum) tomatoes, seeded and chopped</li>
  <li  class="li">1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
  <li  class="li">½ English (seedless) cucumber - peeled, seeded, and cubed</li>
  <li  class="li">2 tablespoons minced shallot</li>
  <li  class="li">2 tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
  <li  class="li">1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
  <li  class="li">1 ½ teaspoons salt, or to taste</li>
  <li  class="li">¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
  <li  class="li">2 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese</li>
  <li  class="li">2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro</li>
 </ul>
 <h2 class="one">Steps</h2>
 <ol class="ol">
  <li  class="li">Combine watermelon, tomatoes, red pepper, cucumber, shallot, lime juice, vinegar, salt, and pepper in a high-powered blender. Blend until smooth, 20 to 30 seconds. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour to allow flavors to meld and soup to chill.</li>
  <li  class="li">Stir gazpacho before serving, as it has a tendency to separate, and divide between 4 bowls. Top with feta cheese and cilantro.</li>
 </ol>
 <h2>Cook's Tip</h2>
 <p class="li">To seed tomatoes, cut in half horizontally and gently squeeze to release seeds and excess liquid.</p>
