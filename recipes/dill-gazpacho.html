 <h3>Highlight summer's best produce with this herbaceous gazpacho. Make it a full meal by serving with a side of crusty bread for cleaning out the bowl.</h3>
 <p>A fresh and mild gazpacho that takes advantage of all that summer has to offer. Super easy too. Garnish with a sprig of fresh dill and serve chilled.</p>
